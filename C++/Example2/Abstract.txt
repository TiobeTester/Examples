The CppSamp project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' microcontroller
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz


The C++ Examples 2 shows some features of the C++ language:

  - Opeation Overloading
  - Name Spaces
  - Friend Functions


The program is available in different targets:

  STM32F103 Simulator:  configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:      configured for on-chip Flash
                        (used for production or target debugging)
