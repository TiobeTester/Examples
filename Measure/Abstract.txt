The Measure project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' microcontroller
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
 - USART1 settings:
   - 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 - AD settings:
   - 12 bit resolution
   - conversion is done in DMA mode


The Measure program uses analog and digital inputs to simulate a datalogger.
You may watch the value of analog input POT1 and the state of S2, S3 Buttons
on MCBSTM32 Evaluation Board.



The program is available in different targets:

  STM32F103 Simulator:  configured for software Simulator
                        ADC1 channel 1 simulated using a debug function.

  STM32F103 Flash:      configured for on-chip Flash
                        (used for production or target debugging)
