The RamFunction project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' microcontroller
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz


The RamFunction program demonstrates how to define a function that
executes in RAM. This may be useful for IAP Flash programming or to
improve to the performance with slow external Flash devices.

Functions that are be executed in RAM should reside in a seperate
source module. Using the 'Options for File' dialog you can simply change
the 'Code / Const' area of a module to a memory space in physical RAM.

Available memory areas are declared in the 'Target' tab of the
'Options for Target' dialog.

In this example the internal RAM area is split into two areas IRAM1, IRAM2.


The program is available in different targets:

  STM32F103 Simulator:  configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:      configured for on-chip Flash
                        (used for production or target debugging)
