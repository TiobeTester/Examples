The Memory project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' microcontroller
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz


The Memory program demonstrates how to setup a simple
custom Memory Layout for the selected Target.

It shows how to define Memory regions which are mapped
to actual Memory like ROM, RAM, FLASH ...
It also shows how to setup the Stack and Heap.


The program is available for target:

  STM32F103 Simulator:  configured for software Simulator
