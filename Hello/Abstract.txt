The Hello project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' microcontroller
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
 - USART1 settings:
   - 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Hello program is a very simple program that prints "Hello World"
to the serial port USART1 of the STM32F103.  When you can successfully
build and run this program, you have used the entire toolset including:
  - The uVision integrated development environment.
  - The Real-View compiler, linker and the µVision simulator/debugger.


The program is available in different targets:

  STM32F103 Simulator:  configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:      configured for on-chip Flash
                        (used for production or target debugging)
