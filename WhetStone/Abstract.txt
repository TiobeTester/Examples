The WhetStone project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' microcontroller
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
 - USART1 settings:
   - 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

This program contains the Whetstone benchmarks.

Whetstone is a benchmark test which attempts to
measure the speed and efficiency at which a computer
performs floating-point operations.  The results of
the test are given in units called whetstones.


The program is available in different targets:

  STM32F103 Simulator:  configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:      configured for on-chip Flash
                        (used for production or target debugging)
